Your online stores likes to give out coupons, but people are trying to cheat the system. 

A valid coupon is in the format of NNNNLLLLL-NN (4 numbers indicating the current year, followed by 5 indicating the first 5 letters of a month name, followed by a hyphen, then by 2 numbers).

Write a method that validates if a user provided string is a valid coupon code or not.
