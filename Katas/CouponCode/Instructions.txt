Your online stores likes to give out coupons, but people are trying to cheat the system. 

A valid coupon is in the format of NNNNLLL-NN (4 numbers indicating the current year, followed by 3 indicating the first 3 letters of a month name, followed by a hyphen, then by 2 numbers).

Notes:
Must be 10 characters
Must start with the current year
Must follow current year with first 3 characters of a month
Must end with hyphen, followed by 2 digits
